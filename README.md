# Riverside-Precompiler
A precompiler tool used to eliminate some side effects of Instance collapsing within Hammer.

## Usage
Drag your .vmf map file onto the .exe - which you can download from the [releases](https://github.com/riverside-roleplay/Riverside-Precompiler/releases/) section. <br>
Make sure your vmf has either already been collapsed or doesn't contain any func_instance entities - otherwise your vmf may become corrupted.
